# It is indeed a WEBrick issue.

# @KenThompson the problem is Webrick, not Rails.
# Webrick do not support keep-alive connections and thus raises the warning/issue
# we're seeing. It is recommended you use a proper/better webserver
# (like thin or passenger standalone) for web.
# Upcoming versions of Ruby will fix this issue.
